Eutrophication of water body will produce a series of environmental problems, among which cyanobacteria bloom is one of the most studied and seriously polluted problems. It is of great significance to effectively control the occurrence of cyanobacteria blooms by predicting and simulating the outbreak process of cyanobacteria blooms and accurately forecasting the relevant governance departments. However, there are two problems in the existing analysis of algal blooms: on the one hand, it is difficult to consider the impact of other factors on cyanobacteria blooms by taking chlorophyll concentration as the main influencing factor, and it is also unable to determine the relationship between various factors. On the other hand, only based on the field monitoring data research, lack of comprehensive analysis of the whole water area. The remote sensing image can reflect the change of the whole water area, but the traditional analysis method is difficult to deal with the massive remote sensing data effectively. In this study, eutrophication level was used as characterization index of cyanobacteria bloom, and the remote sensing image and its inversion map were taken as the main research data, and a new method of cyanobacteria bloom prediction based on four-dimensional (4D) fractal CNN was proposed. The prediction model uses 4D fractal CNN to extract the features of multi factor remote sensing images, capture the temporal and spatial characteristics and the interaction between multiple factors, and predict the eutrophication level of water body. In this study, a total of 216 remote sensing images of Taihu Lake Basin were selected from 29 groups with fine weather from 2009 to 2010 obtained by MODIS satellite. The simulation results show that the method proposed in this paper has excellent prediction performance, and the accuracy rate of 85.71% is better than that of common 3D CNN and 4D CNN models.","Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Multidisciplinary Sciences",Mathematics; Science & Technology - Other Topics,yes,MODIS,Cyanobacteria bloom prediction,Water,multi-factor status prediction by 4d fractal cnn based on remote sensing images,Segmentation,no,71.43,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The collected multi-temporal remote sensed data contain rich information for Earth monitoring applications, from flood detection to crop classification. To easily classify such naturally multidimensional data, conventional low-order deep learning models unavoidably toss away valuable information residing across the available dimensions. In this work, we extend state-of-the-art convolutional network models based on the U-Net architecture to their high-dimensional analogs, which can naturally capture multi-dimensional dependencies and correlations. We introduce several model architectures, both of low as well as of high order, and we quantify the achieved classification performance vis-a-vis the latest state-of-the-art methods. The experimental analysis on observations from Landsat-8 reveals that approaches based on low-order U-Net models exhibit poor classification performance and are outperformed by our proposed high-dimensional U-Net scheme.","Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,yes,Landsat-8,Land-cover classification ,Vegetation,4d u-nets for multi-temporal remote sensing data classification,Segmentation,yes,61.56,61.56,61.56,61.56,,,,,44.47,,,,,,

Deep learning methods have demonstrated a great potential in analyzing such observations. Traditional 2D and 3D approaches are unable to effectively extract valuable information encoded across all available dimensions. In this work, we propose the extension of current fully-convolutional models for multi-temporal remote sensing data classification to their high-dimensional analogs, which can naturally capture multi-dimensional dependencies and correlations. Experimental analysis on recently released observations from Landsat-8 reveals that our proposed high-dimensional fully-convolutional approach exhibits a clear classification performance improvement over state of the art low-order fully-convolutional models.
